My name is Erik Cowley. This site is my portfolio for my personal projects, mainly on the topic of data science.

I currently work as an engineer at ScienceLogic, where I develop Python software for monitoring servers and switches. Previously I worked as a teaching assistant at [BloomTech (previously Lambda School)](https://www.bloomtech.com/), helping students learn data science, computer science and Python development. My other professional experience includes Python backend development, frontend development with knockout.js, and Java development. ([My resume in pdf form](https://stromsy.nfshost.com/content/erik-cowley-resume-08-31-2021.pdf)).

The website name "stromsy" is derived from "Straumsey" (meaning "stormy seas"), which was the name of an island encountered by Lief Erikson. It is mentioned in [The Saga of Erik the Red](https://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en).
